PatroAutroController is a customizable auto-clicking joystick powered by an ESP32 and built upon the FreeRTOS real-time operating system. The project's core function is to generate repeated joystick button presses at a variable rate, which is controlled in real-time by an analog potentiometer. It emphasizes a robust, multi-tasking software architecture for responsive and reliable performance, with an onboard LED providing visual feedback for each simulated action.
